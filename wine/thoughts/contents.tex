\chapter{Defining the problem}

\section{Predict the cultivar of wine}
We have data from wines from three different cultivars from the same region in Italy \cite{info}. Given some qualities from the wine, like alchohol, acid, etc. we have to predict which cultivar derived an instance.

\section{History of the dataset}
The dataset was dontated by Riccardo Leardi, the data is from three different cultivars from the same region in Italy \cite{info}.

\section{Attribute information}
All attributes are continuous
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Alchohol 
    \item Malic acid
    \item Ash
    \item Alcalinity of ash
    \item Magnesium
    \item Total phenols 
    \item Flavanoids
    \item Nonflavanoid phenols
    \item Proanthocyanins 
    \item Color intensity 
    \item Hue 
    \item OD280/OD315 of diluted wines 
    \item Proline
\end{enumerate}
